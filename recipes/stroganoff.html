  <h3>Directions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until 
      nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring 
      constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid 
      evaporates and meat browns.
    </li>
    <li>Remove meat from the pan and set aside. 
      Stir mushrooms, onions, and butter into the pan; 
      cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables are 
      lightly browned.
    </li>
    <li>Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; 
      cook for 1 to 2 minutes until incorporated. Stir in 
      wine and 1 cup of broth, scraping the bottom of the 
      pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer 
      and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of 
      broth; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for 
      about 1 hour, covered, until beef is tender and 
      sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season 
      with salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
